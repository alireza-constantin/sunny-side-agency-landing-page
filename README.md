## [**Sunny Side Agency Landing Page**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5)

- **Level : `JUNIOR`**

- **Lang : `HTML, CSS, JS`**

## What I Learned
This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS.

## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
